title: UI text writing style

The rules are:

- Capitalize first letter of everything - from single words to sentences.
- Finish with a period only if it's a full sentence - e.g. not if it's a heading, short instruction, etc.
- Always make punctuation part of the translated string (so that RTL languages don't start with a period, for example).
- Use real ellipsis character (<code>â€¦</code>) rather than three periods (<code>...</code>)<sup>1</sup>.
- Remember that our name is capitalized like this: `KoboToolbox`.

If in doubt, please mimick what is already there.

<small><sup>1</sup> In MacOS use `cmd` + `;`. In Windows it's `alt` + `0` `1` `3` `3` on the numberpad. Microsoft Office applications use `ctrl` + `alt` + `.`.</small>
