title: UI text writing style
TODO_NOTE: This article will need to be updated a bit when we switch to string identifiers in the UI code.
---

The rules are:

- Capitalize first letter of everything - from single words to sentences.
- Finish with a period only if it's a full sentence - e.g. not if it's a heading, short instruction, etc.
- Always make punctuation part of the translated string (so that RTL languages don't start with a period, for example).
- Use real ellipsis character (<code>â€¦</code>) rather than three periods (<code>...</code>)<sup>1</sup>.
- Remember that our name is capitalized like this: `KoboToolbox`.

If in doubt, please mimic what is already there.

<small><sup>1</sup> On MacOS use `option` + `;`. On Windows it's `alt` + `0` `1` `3` `3` on the numberpad. Microsoft Office applications use `ctrl` + `alt` + `.`. On Linux, press `<compose key>` + `.` followed by `.`, or, if you do not have a compose key configured, press `ctrl` + `shift` + `u`, release, type `2`, `0`, `2`, `6`, and then press `enter`.</small>
